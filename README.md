A Chess Game I made from scratch.

This project is a chess game in which all of the components are made from scratch (with the exception of the the icons, which I got free online).  The game is fully functional and two players can play a full game of chess. It also includes a save game/ load game option as well as the an undo move option. Although only two player mode is available as of now, I hope to write a chess engine from scratch and add it.
